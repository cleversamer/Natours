# Advanced CSS and Sass
I used some of npm packages for development process and build process, and they are installed globally.
HINT: I had some issues when I tried to install them as dev dependencies, so I installed them globally and then no issues happened.
* Getting started:
1. npm i -g node-sass
2. npm i -g concat
3. npm i -g postcss-cli
4. npm i -g autoprefixer
5. npm i -g npm-run-all
